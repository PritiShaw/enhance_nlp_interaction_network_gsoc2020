July 2020, has brought in several happy moments for me, first passing the First Evaluation of GSoC and second being my first paycheck.   
My evaluation feedback was positive and I am thankful to my mentor Augustin, for highlight things which I was not doing correctly.    
I will try to communicate more in every few days.  

## Work Progress  

1. **Extract Data for Reactome Articles**  

    Status: **Complete**  

    The objective was to extract the MeSH, publication year, journal , PMC ID from the list of PMIDs obtained from the [reactome.org](https://reactome.org/download/current/ReactionPMIDS.txt). The list of PMIDs contains many duplicates IDs. So firstly, I had to make the list unique.  

    **Issue:** [Extract Data for Reactome Articles ](https://github.com/cannin/enhance_nlp_interaction_network_gsoc2020/issues/6)  
    **Output:** [Gist](https://gist.github.com/PritiShaw/9ad43241c99f727afd04efbe0bdb77e8)  
   
## Conclusion 

For the next period, we need to make sure code that doesn't go into INDRA is well documented and reproducible, probably Docker.
