Last few weeks have been very interesting, I got chance to meet the community and understand how our project will help them. I have passed the second evaluation successfully. Thanks to my mentor Augustin for this oppurtunity. I will keep in mind the feedback he gave.

### Work Progress

1. [Colab Notebook Showing Use of MTI with Arbitrary Text](https://github.com/cannin/enhance_nlp_interaction_network_gsoc2020/issues/15)  
    Status: **Complete**  
    Path to Notebook : [MTI MeSH Extraction Example
](https://github.com/cannin/enhance_nlp_interaction_network_gsoc2020/blob/master/MTI_MeSH_Extraction_Example.ipynb)  

2. [Documentation for Google Colab Notebooks](https://github.com/cannin/enhance_nlp_interaction_network_gsoc2020/issues/13)  
    Status: **Complete**  
    
4. [Add Documentation/Tests/Dockerfile to Reactome Failed Search Code](https://github.com/cannin/enhance_nlp_interaction_network_gsoc2020/issues/12)     
    Status: **In Progress**  
    The python notebook has been parameterized which will make it easy for the users to set credentials and other details using [Papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill). All the notebooks are now compatible with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
    
### Conclusion
Overall this was a productive week, our Python notebooks are ready. and probably Reactome community will start using it before I leave. The community is really helpul and they accept new members whole heatedly. It was really great to interact with some of the greats of the field.
