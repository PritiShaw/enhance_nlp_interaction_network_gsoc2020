This week I have made the Notebooks compatible with Bindle. Initially I was finding it difficult and I had to explore to arrive at the solution.  

The setup  has been done to run both Python and R notebooks.

### Work Tracker
[Add Documentation/Tests/Dockerfile to Reactome Failed Search Code](https://github.com/cannin/enhance_nlp_interaction_network_gsoc2020/issues/12)


### Conclusion
The week as a bit rough as my laptop stopped working. With only few weeks remaining in GSoC 2020 I hope that I am able to end it smoothly in a high note.
