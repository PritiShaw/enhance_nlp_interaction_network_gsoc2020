## About Me
I am an undergraduate student, pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at [Jadavpur University](http://jaduniv.edu.in), Kolkata, India.
My interests lie in the field of technology and computer science. I believe in learning a new thing every day.

## GSoC Project

- [GSoC Project URL](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5223231348277248)
- [Work Repository](https://github.com/cannin/enhance_nlp_interaction_network_gsoc2020)
- [GSoC Project Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkqFd_qcpsbbDGSO172WUiNIF25AWuxKHON49RylpPE/edit?usp=sharing)

Mentor:  
**Augustin Luna** ([@cannin](https://github.com/cannin))  
**Benjamin M. Gyori** ([@bgyori](https://github.com/bgyori))          


## Community Bonding  
This period of GSoC started after the project announcements. I was introduced to the community and get to know more about it.  
This report marks the end of the Community Bonding period.  

## Tasks  
During the community bonding period, I was assigned the following work:

1. **Get Indra running and Improve the documentation**  
    Status: **Complete**  
    [Python code provided by the Mentor for running Indra](https://gist.github.com/cannin/5f9d83ed4b52a489e57726cfe2ba574a)  
    **Pull Request:**    
            - [Improve Documentation of IndraNetAssembler](https://github.com/sorgerlab/indra/pull/1093)  

2. **Test the abstract text with two possible automated tools**  
    Status: **Complete**  
    **Result:** After comparing MESHonDemand and MESH MTI. The output from both services are a bit different.  The average time taken by Web API (MESH MTI) is around 45 seconds which was 17 seconds in case of MESHonDemand(Web Tool).  

3. **Extracting MeSH Terms for Articles**  
    Status: **Complete**  
    The comparison between Mesh terms produced by using WebAPI and Eutil and dispaying it in a TSV file.  
    **Repository:** [Analyze-MESH](https://github.com/PritiShaw/Analyze-MESH)      
    **Issue:** [Extracting MeSH Terms for Articles](https://github.com/cannin/enhance_nlp_interaction_network_gsoc2020/issues/1)

4. **Make Chrome Plugin into Separate GitHub Repo**      
    Status: **Complete**  
    **Repository :** [highlight-pmc-chrome-extension](https://github.com/PritiShaw/highlight-pmc-chrome-extension)  
    **Issue:** [Make Chrome Plugin into Separate GitHub Repo](https://github.com/cannin/enhance_nlp_interaction_network_gsoc2020/issues/3)  

5. **Test Chrome Extension in Microsoft Edge**       
    Status: **Complete**  
    The [Highlight PMC Chrome Extension](https://github.com/PritiShaw/highlight-pmc-chrome-extension) highlights the extracted sentence in the article page in the library.  
    **Issue:** [Test Chrome Extension in Microsoft Edge](https://github.com/cannin/enhance_nlp_interaction_network_gsoc2020/issues/4)     

## Conclusion  

It has been a great learning experience so far. I had very little experience in working with python for web services, but I am using it now since the first day of Google Summer of Code 2020. I am enjoying the journey.  
My Mentors,are constantly helping me. They is just a message away, whenever I require their guidance. I am thankful to themm.
